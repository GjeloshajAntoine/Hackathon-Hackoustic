# Hackoustic

A project made for the Hackathon of the CIRB (Centre d'Informatique pour la RÃ©gion Bruxelloise) and BeCode.

As of 2018, it will be soon required for bars and coffee shops to limit their noise level.
In order to help them do that, we developped a little plateform to measure and display the a amount of noise of a certain place.


The plateform is made of two parts, one is a website, no app needed, it is aimed at smartphones of the clients of coffee shops and measure the sound.
The second part is an electron app, it takes the sound measurement of all connected smartphones and displays colors that indicates if the sound level is acceptable or not.
